        | Combinatorial properties of degree sequences of 3-uniform hypergraphs arising from saind arrays

        | The characterization of k-uniform hypergraphs by their degree sequences, say k-sequences, has been a longstanding open problem for k>2. Very recently its decision version was proved to be NP-complete by Deza et al. Formally, the decision version of the problem is: Given π=(d1,d2,…,dn) a non increasing sequence of positive integers, is π the degree sequence of a k-uniform simple hypergraph? The NP-completeness reduction uses, in an intermediate step, a subclass of 3-uniform hypergraphs whose incidence matrices are computed starting from a sequence of integer numbers. In general, the complexity of the reconstruction of the elements of such a subclass is unknown.
